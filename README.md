# Identity Management Smart Contract

## Overview

This Clarity smart contract provides a robust and secure identity management system on the Stacks blockchain, enabling decentralized identity registration, credential issuance, reputation tracking, and identity recovery mechanisms.

## Features

### 1. Identity Management

- Register new identities with unique hash and optional recovery address
- Identity status tracking (ACTIVE, RECOVERED)
- Limit of one identity per principal

### 2. Credential Management

- Issue credentials to registered identities
- Maximum of 10 credentials per identity
- Credentials include:
  - Claim hash
  - Expiration block
  - Revocation status
  - Metadata

### 3. Reputation System

- Track reputation scores for each identity
- Scores range from 0 to 1000
- Only admin can update reputation scores

### 4. Recovery Mechanism

- Set optional recovery address during identity registration
- Recover identity with a new hash through designated recovery address

## Contract Functions

### Administrative Functions

- `set-admin`: Change contract administrator

### Identity Functions

- `register-identity`: Create a new identity
- `initiate-recovery`: Recover an identity using recovery address

### Credential Functions

- `issue-credential`: Issue a new credential to an identity
- `add-credential-to-identity`: Add a credential to an identity
- `revoke-credential`: Revoke an existing credential
- `verify-credential`: Check credential validity

### Reputation Functions

- `update-reputation`: Modify an identity's reputation score

### Query Functions

- `get-identity`: Retrieve identity details
- `get-credential`: Retrieve credential information
- `get-proof`: Retrieve zero-knowledge proof data

## Error Handling

The contract includes comprehensive error handling with specific error codes:

- `ERR-NOT-AUTHORIZED`: Unauthorized access attempt
- `ERR-ALREADY-REGISTERED`: Identity already exists
- `ERR-INVALID-CREDENTIAL`: Invalid credential
- `ERR-INVALID-SCORE`: Invalid reputation score modification
- And more (12 distinct error codes)

## Constraints and Validations

### Identity Constraints

- Unique identity hash required
- Recovery address cannot be the transaction sender or admin

### Credential Constraints

- Maximum 10 credentials per identity
- Credentials must have valid expiration
- Metadata length limited to 256 characters

### Reputation Constraints

- Reputation score range: 0-1000
- Score can only be modified by admin

## Zero-Knowledge Proofs

Supports storage and verification of zero-knowledge proofs with:

- Proof hash
- Prover principal
- Verification status
- Timestamp
- Proof data

## Security Considerations

- Admin-controlled critical functions
- Input validation for all critical operations
- Prevents duplicate registrations
- Credential expiration and revocation mechanisms
- Recovery address for identity restoration

## Deployment Considerations

- Requires Stacks blockchain environment
- Compatible with Clarity smart contract platforms
- Recommended to deploy using Clarinet or similar Stacks development tools

## Example Workflow

1. Admin registers the contract
2. Users register identities
3. Admin issues credentials
4. Admin updates reputation scores
5. Users can recover identities via recovery address

## Potential Use Cases

- Decentralized identity verification
- Professional credential management
- Reputation tracking systems
- Academic and professional certification platforms
- Blockchain-based trust networks

## Dependencies

- Stacks blockchain
- Clarity smart contract language
- Clarinet development environment
